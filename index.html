          The soldiers' training begins with a three-day training process. <br>
          After that the soldiers begin the training, which lasts about a year and two months. <br>
          During the training, the soldiers will spend weeks firing, fighting in a built-up and open area, 
          as well as the following courses: </p>
          <ul>
               <li><em>Counter-terrorism</em></li>
               <li><em> Underground warfare</em> </li>
               <li><em>Intelligence and patrol</em> </li>
          </ul>
